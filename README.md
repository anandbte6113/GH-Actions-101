# GH-Actions-101
To get thorough with GH-Actions 

the first workflow GH-Actions-101.yml fails cause the runner doesnt have access to repo. so it cant read the README.md file so we have to explicitly give access to repo and let it download the repo to the runner and then it can access the README.md file. Removing the trigger after the work is done with GH-Actions-101 to show how we are progressing the workflows.
